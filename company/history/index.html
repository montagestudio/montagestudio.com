        <p>Software powers the user experience on computers, mobile and wearable devices, and in the cloud. It starts with design — which is not just about appearance. Design is how it works and this requires designers iterating hand-in-hand with developers to deliver a superior user experience. Next, software is integrated with cloud APIs, refined, instrumented, tested, released and monitored. Currently, there is no end-to-end solution that supports cloud-based application development from design to production.</p>

        <p>Montage Studio is based on the MontageJS HTML5 framework developed over time by CEO Benoit Marchant and his team. The technological path toward Montage Studio originated at Apple(1999-2010), where Benoit worked on bringing the ease-of-use of Mac OS X user interfaces to the Web. On this journey, Benoit worked with several talented engineers to build modern, intuitive web applications for the iTunes Store, Apple Retail and apple.com. That group would later become the core of the Montage Studio team.

        <p>In the summer of 2010, Benoit left Apple for Motorola Mobility. He was quickly joined there by some of his key engineers to develop a new HTML5 platform for mobile. After 4 years of experience developing their first framework together at Apple, they started over, building a new framework. By applying some of the key strengths of iOS development to HTML5, they created MontageJS, a modern HTML5 framework that simplifies the development of expressive HTML5 mobile applications.

        <p>In 2012, Google took over Motorola Mobility and Benoit and his team then developed on a number of Google applications with MontageJS, which was also used for building Google Web Designer. Motorola later chose not to continue the team’s work, but allowed it to be open sourced on GitHub under a BSD license.</p>

        <p>Montage Studio was founded with the vision of a true web-native universal SDK, a framework, and authoring combined as one creative, collaborative environment where web designers and developers would work seamlessly together, from start to finish, to deliver rich applications, made with HTML5, across billions of devices.</p>
